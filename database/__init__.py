# This file makes 'database' a Python package.
# It can contain imports for easier access to database-related functions if desired,
# but is often kept empty.

# Example (optional):
# from .nist_data_fetcher import main as run_nist_fetcher
# from .atomic_data_builder import main as run_atomic_data_builder
